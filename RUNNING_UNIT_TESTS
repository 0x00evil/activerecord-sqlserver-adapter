== Creating the test database

The default names for the test databases are "activerecord_unittest" and 
"activerecord_unittest2". If you want to use another database name then be sure 
to update the connection adapter setups you want to test with in 
test/connections/<your database>/connection.rb. 

The connection files make certain assumptions. For instance, the ODBC connection 
assumes you have a DSN setup that matches the name of the default database names.


== Requirements

  * gem install shoulda
  * gem install mocha

The tests of this adapter depend on the existence of rails checkout. Make sure 
to checkout remotes/origin/2-3-stable, then make sure to export RAILS_SOURCE to 
the full path of that repo.

Define a user named 'rails' in SQL Server with all privileges granted for the 
test databases. Use an empty password for said user.
