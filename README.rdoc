== Rails SQL Server 2000 & 2005 Adapter

For Rails/ActiveRecord 2.2 and up. More details to come.


== Installation
  
This method is unconfirmed. You can install the adapter as a gem using the following command. Once I confirm this I can give you an example of a config.gem command too. For now I know that rails and/or ActiveRecord expects to find the SQL Server adapter in the vendor/plugins/adapters/sqlserver folder of your rails project.

  $ sudo gem install rails-sqlserver-2000-2005-adapter

Ruby DBI is required and to my knowledge the ADO DBD driver is no longer supported, meaning that ODBC is the only way to go. During development ancient versions of DBI back to 0.0.23 were tested along with the current latest 0.4.0 version. Because later versions of DBI will be changing many things, IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you install 0.4.0 which the examples below show. This is not a compressive how to since ODBC mode requires also that you install Ruby ODBC and possibly FreeTDS.

  $ sudo gem install dbi --version 0.4.0
  $ sudo gem install dbd-odbc --version 0.2.4

Optionally configure your gem dependencies in your rails environment.rb file.

  config.gem 'dbi', :version => '0.4.0'
  config.gem 'dbd-odbc', :version => '0.2.4', :lib => 'dbd/ODBC'
