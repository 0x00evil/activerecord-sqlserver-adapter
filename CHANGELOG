* 2.2.10/11 * (January 22nd, 2009)

* Add a rails-sqlserver-2000-2005-adapter.rb file so that long :lib option for config.gem is no longer needed.


* 2.2.9 * (January 22nd, 2009)

* Fixing a small bug in the deprecated DBI::Timestamp conversion so it correctly converts nanosecond whole 
  numbers to back to pre type cast SQL Server milliseconds, ultimately allow ruby's Time#usec which is 
  microseconds to be correct. [Ken Collins]
  
* Sometimes views are more than 4000 chars long and will return NULL for the VIEW_DEFINITION. If so, use 
  sp_helptext procedure as a backup method. [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.8 (January 9th, 2009)

* Update execute_procedure method a bit to remove excess code. [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.7 (January 9th, 2009)

* Created a connection#execute_procedure method that takes can take any number of ruby objects as variables 
  and quotes them according to the connection's rules. Also added an ActiveRecord::Base class level core 
  extension that hooks into this. It also checks if the connection responds to #execute_procedure and if 
  not returns an empty array. [Ken Collins]

* Added a #enable_default_unicode_types class attribute access to make all new added or changed string types 
  like :string/:text default to unicode/national data types. See the README for full details. Added a rake 
  task that assists setting this to true when running tests.  [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.6 (January 8th, 2009)

* Introduced a bug in 2.2.5 in the #add_order! core ext for ActiveRecord. Fixed [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.5 (January 4th, 2009)

* Added a log_info_schema_queries class attribute and make all queries to INFORMATION_SCHEMA silent by 
  default. [Ken Collins]

* Fix millisecond support in datetime columns. ODBC::Timestamp incorrectly takes SQL Server milliseconds
  and applies them as nanoseconds. We cope with this at the DBI layer by using SQLServerDBI::Type::SqlserverTimestamp 
  class to parse the before type cast value appropriately. Also update the adapters #quoted_date method 
  to work more simply by converting ruby's #usec milliseconds to SQL Server microseconds. [Ken Collins]

* Core extensions for ActiveRecord now reflect on the connection before doing SQL Server things. Now 
  this adapter is compatible for using with other adapters. [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.4 (December 5th, 2008)

* Fix a type left in #views_real_column_name. Also cache #view_information lookups. [Ken Collins]


* 2.2.3 (December 5th, 2008)

* Changing back to using real table name in column_definitions. Makes sure views get back only the columns 
  that are defined for them with correct names, etc. Now supporting views by looking for NULL default and 
  then if table name is a view, perform a targeted with sub select to the real table name and column name 
  to find true default. [Ken Collins]

* Ensure that add_limit_offset! does not alter sub queries. [Erik Bryn]


2.2.2 (December 2nd, 2008)

* Add support for view defaults by making column_definitions use real table name for schema info. [Ken Collins]

* Include version in connection method and inspection. [Ken Collins]


2.2.1 (November 25th, 2008)

* Add identity insert support for views. Cache #views so that identity #table_name_or_views_table_name 
  will run quickly. [Ken Collins]

* Add views support. ActiveRecord classes can use views. The connection now has a #views method and 
  #table_exists? will not fall back to checking views too. [Ken Collins]


2.2.0 (November 21st, 2008)

* Release for rails 2.2.2. Many many changes.  [Ken Collins], [Murray Steele], [Shawn Balestracci], [Joe Rafaniello]
