* Include version in connection method and inspection. [Ken Collins]


2.2.1 (November 25th, 2008)

* Add identity insert support for views. Cache #views so that identity #table_name_or_views_table_name 
  will run quickly. [Ken Collins]

* Add views support. ActiveRecord classes can use views. The connection now has a #views method and 
  #table_exists? will not fall back to checking views too. [Ken Collins]

* Release for rails 2.2.2. Many many changes.  [Ken Collins], [Murray Steele], [Shawn Balestracci], [Joe Rafaniello]
